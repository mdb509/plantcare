# PlantCare

This project has two goals.

1.  Developing a arduino programm, which handels all automated processes to maintain a plant.
    This includes watering, water level monitoring, batterie and solarcell monitoring, sending data to web client.
2.  Developing a web application for browser/smartphone (not sure if both) for monitoring plant data. 
    App should be modular, because it would be nice to add multiply plants.
